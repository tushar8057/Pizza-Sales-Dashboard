     FROM pizza_sales
     GROUP BY pizza_name
     ORDER BY Total_Orders ASC
     ```


## Applying Filters

If you want to apply filters to the above queries, you can use the `WHERE` clause in SQL. For example:

```sql
SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE pizza_category = 'Classic'
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Orders ASC
```
